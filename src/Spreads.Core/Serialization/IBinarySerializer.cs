    // TODO Settings.ProtectedCopy to write first to a temp buffer for custom binary converters
    // Impl always checks SizeOf, then allocates buffer and then gives that buffer to the Write
    // method. That is fine for blittables and JSON, we know their impl is correct by construction.
    // Actually, all converters that return temp buffer are checked, if temp buffer size is wrong
    // the write will fail. We only need to protect writes that do not return temp buffer
    // (subject to Write just uses it and do not calls Converter's Write, this is true now and
    // should not change). This should be on by default and a separate setting, not a part of
    // AdditionalCorrectnessCheck, which protects from wrong usage of DirectBuffer API, but not
    // from direct pointer write overruns.
    // This is data corruption issue and could happen not intentionally, e.g. wrong write method
    // implementation, so it's important to have. (we ignore possible corruption from intentional
    // or plain wrong misuse).
