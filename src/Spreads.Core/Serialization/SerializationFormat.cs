    /// Binary serialization format. Serialized data always has a header describing the method of
    /// binary serialization. The data could be Json, but because of the header it is not directly
    /// consumable by e.g. browsers. However, for Json/JsonGZip cases the only difference is
    /// the header and the rest payload could be directly sent to a browser expecting 'application/json'
    /// MIME type.

    /// JsonGZip:
    /// Objects are converted to Json and compressed with JsonGZip method. This format is compatible with raw
    /// http payload with 'Accept-encoding: gzip' headers past the 8 bytes header.

    /// BinaryLz4/Zstd:
    /// Binary is stored as blittable representation with Blosc byteshuffle for arrays with fixed-size elements.
    /// Then serialized (and byteshuffled) buffer is compressed with LZ4 (super fast but lower compression) or
    /// Zstd (still fast and high compression, preferred method) if compression gives smaller size.
    /// Actual buffer layout is type dependent.

    /// Serialized buffer has a header with a flag indicating the format and
    /// whether or not the buffer is compressed. Some data types are stored as deltas
    /// with diffing performed before byteshuffling and the header must have such flag as well.

    /// SerializationFormat should not be confused with Transport/Protocol format:
    /// * Text trasport/protocol supports only JSON and the payload is plain or gzipped JSON that
    ///   could be consumed by browsers or http servers (with headers indicating the actual format - compressed or not).
    /// * Binary trasport/protocol cannot be consumed directly by browsers or http servers. The exact data layout of payload
    ///   depends on data type and is encoded in a 4 (+ optional 4 bytes length for variable sized data) bytes header.
    ///   Data could be serialized as JSON (mostly for convenience if a type is not used a lot and not blittable)
